Email Spam or Ham Classifier
Welcome to the Email Spam or Ham Classifier project! In this repository, we delve into the fascinating realm of email classification, distinguishing between "spam" and "ham" (legitimate) emails. Through a comprehensive exploration of machine learning models, we aim to create an effective solution for identifying and filtering out spam emails. Our project utilizes advanced natural language processing (NLP) techniques and machine learning algorithms to enhance email security and improve your inbox experience.

Project Highlights
Best-Performing Model: Among the diverse range of machine learning models investigated, we've identified a standout performer. Our top model achieved an impressive R-squared (R2) score of 98%, showcasing its remarkable ability to accurately classify spam and ham emails.

Model Comparison: We systematically compared and evaluated various machine learning models, providing detailed insights into their strengths, weaknesses, and comparative performance. Our analysis aids in selecting the most suitable model for your email classification needs.

Data Preprocessing: Our project prioritizes data quality. We started with a thorough data cleaning process to address missing values and ensure the integrity of our dataset.

Feature Engineering: To boost model performance, we ventured into feature engineering, crafting informative features that significantly improved our email classification accuracy.
